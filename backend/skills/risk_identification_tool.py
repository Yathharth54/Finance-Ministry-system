def risk_identification(projections: dict) -> str:
    """
    Computes a risk ranking ("low", "medium", or "high") based on projected values.
    The projections dictionary is expected to contain:
      - "projected_revenue": a list of items with "projected_amount"
      - "projected_expenditure": a list of items with "projected_amount"
      - "projected_inflation": a dict with "rate"
      - "projected_gdp_growth": a dict with "rate"
    
    Risk factors considered:
      1. Deficit Risk: If total expenditure exceeds revenue.
         - If deficit ratio (deficit / revenue) > 0.1 -> high risk (1)
         - If deficit ratio > 0 but <= 0.1 -> medium risk (0.5)
         - Else -> low risk (0)
      2. Inflation Risk:
         - Inflation > 4% -> high risk (1)
         - 3% <= Inflation <= 4% -> medium risk (0.5)
         - Else -> low risk (0)
      3. GDP Growth Risk:
         - GDP growth < 2.5% -> high risk (1)
         - 2.5% <= GDP growth < 3% -> medium risk (0.5)
         - Else -> low risk (0)
    
    The final risk score is computed as a weighted average:
      risk_score = 0.4 * (deficit risk) + 0.3 * (inflation risk) + 0.3 * (GDP growth risk)
    
    Risk Ranking:
      - risk_score < 0.3 -> "low"
      - 0.3 <= risk_score < 0.6 -> "medium"
      - risk_score >= 0.6 -> "high"
    
    Returns the overall risk ranking as a string.
